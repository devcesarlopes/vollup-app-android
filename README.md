## First Steps
1. First download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?hl=pt&gclid=CjwKCAjw3riIBhAwEiwAzD3TiWGMLwJfHW4meMvGt4mY-y4UFzd1YzDHvJ6nReMEw04JFntq2vSJ0BoCyfgQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds), and all of it's contents.
2. After Android Studio download and installation, create a project, choosing the **API version**, ```Java``` or ```Kotlin``` for language and name.
Obs: Never forget to create the project in **Github repository** so it's easier to commit changes and keep tracking versions.
3. In project, check if all ***SDK files*** are updated.

## Developing
Some users start the App development from the back-end, other from front-end.
I personally prefer always start from front-end. From my experience during my work as App Dev at UFBA, I think that it's easier to start from front-end because: 
- It's easier to view all the app's functionalities and promote changes.
- It's easier to reuse variables and structure the back-end with proper efficency.

In this project we already have the app design that contains 2 screens, ```login``` and ```main activity```.
